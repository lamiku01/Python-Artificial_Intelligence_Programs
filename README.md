# Python-Artificial_Intelligence_Programs
All programs are written in Python for my Artificial Intelligence course. The programs all attempt to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): A salesman is given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of city locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly one time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also known as a Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. Detailed descriptions of each file are found below. 

1. TSP_bruteforce: Implements a brute force approach to calculate the minimum cost paths for a series of generated city locations
2. BFSDFS: Implements  Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms to find the shortes path between the starting and goal city
3. TSP_GreedyHeuristic: Solves an instance of a TSP probleem by using a variant of the greedy heuristic
4. GeneticAlgorithmTSP: Implements a genetic algoriithm for a TSP dataset with up to 100 cities
5. WisdomOfCrowds: Mooifies the previous program to utilize the Wisdom of Crowds approach in combination with a genetic algorithm to solve a TSP dataset with up to 222 cities
